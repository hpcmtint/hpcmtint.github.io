The history of Burma, also known as Myanmar, since the British invasion is complex and marked by significant political and social changes. Here's a summarized overview:

1. **British Colonization (19th Century - 1948)**:
   - The British Empire began its colonization of Burma in the 19th century.
   - Burma became a province of British India in 1886.
   - Under British rule, Burma's economy was heavily exploited, and social tensions simmered.

2. **World War II and Independence (1942 - 1948)**:
   - During World War II, Burma was occupied by Japan.
   - After the war, Aung San, a prominent Burmese nationalist, negotiated independence from the British.
   - Burma gained independence on January 4, 1948.

3. **Early Post-Independence Years (1948 - 1962)**:
   - Burma adopted a democratic system but faced ethnic conflicts and political challenges.
   - In 1962, General Ne Win staged a coup, establishing a military dictatorship.

4. **Military Rule and Isolation (1962 - 2011)**:
   - Under military rule, Burma became isolated from the international community.
   - The junta changed the country's name to Myanmar in 1989.
   - Aung San Suu Kyi, a pro-democracy leader, was placed under house arrest for much of this period.

5. **Pro-Democracy Movement and Reforms (Late 20th Century - Early 21st Century)**:
   - Pro-democracy movements persisted, with Aung San Suu Kyi gaining global recognition.
   - In 2010, a nominally civilian government was established, though the military retained significant control.
   - A series of political reforms followed, leading to elections in 2015, which the National League for Democracy (NLD) won.

6. **Recent Political Developments (2010s - Present)**:
   - Aung San Suu Kyi's NLD formed the government after the 2015 elections, but the military still held substantial power.
   - In 2021, the military staged a coup, detaining Aung San Suu Kyi and other leaders.
   - Protests and civil disobedience movements erupted in response to the coup.
   - Myanmar has since been in a state of political turmoil, with ongoing resistance to military rule.

This summary highlights key points in Myanmar's political history since the British invasion, but it's important to note that the situation is dynamic and evolving.
